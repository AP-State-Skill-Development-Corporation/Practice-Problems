## Problem Statement

As we saw earlier, the Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where every number is the sum of the two numbers before it. The first two numbers are `0` and `1`:

```
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13
```

You must write the `fib()` function which takes in a positive integer, `n`, and returns the *n-th* Fibonacci number. However, instead of using recursion, your function must use any of the loops.

### Sample Input

```python
n = 7
```

### Sample Output

```python
8
```
