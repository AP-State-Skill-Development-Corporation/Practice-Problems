We have following information on Employees and their Salary (Salary is in lakhs),

| **Employee** | **Salary** |
| ------------ | ---------- |
| John         | 14         |
| Smith        | 13         |
| Alice        | 32         |
| Daniel       | 21         |

1. Using above create a dictionary of Employees and their Salary
2. Write a program that asks user for three type of inputs,
    1. print if user enter print then it should print all Employees with their Salary in this format,
        1. John ==>14
        2. Smith ==>13
        3. Alice ==>32
        4.  Daniel ==>21
    2. **add:** if user input adds then it should further ask for an Employee name to add. If Employee already exists in our dataset then it should print that it exists and do nothing. If it doesn't then it asks for Salary and add that new Employee/Salary in our dictionary and print it
    3. **remove:** when user inputs remove it should ask for an Employee to remove. If an Employee exists in our dictionary then remove it and print a new dictionary using format shown above in (a). Else print that Employee doesn't exist!
    4. **get:** on this again ask the user for which Employee he or she wants to get the data. When a user inputs that Employee it will print the Salary of that Employee.
