## Problem Statement

You must implement the `count_low_high()` function. Its parameter is a list of numbers.

If a number is greater than `50` **or** divisible by `3`, it will count as a `high`. If these conditions are not met, the number is considered a `low`.

At the end of the function, you must return a list that contains the number of lows and highs, in that order.

In case the list is empty, you may return `None`.

### Sample Input 

```python
num_list = [20, 9, 51, 81, 50, 42, 77]
```

### Sample Output 

```python
[2, 5] # 2 lows and 5 highs
```
